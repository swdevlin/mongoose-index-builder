## About the Project

The index is generated from tab separated value (TSV) files. The columns in the TSV files are:

- `Document` The abbreviation for the book
- `Topic` The entry in the index
- `Page` Page number for the topic
- `Type` The category for the entry. The column should have been called Category.
- `Primary` If the entry is not the primary entry, a `No` is entered in the column. Non-primary entries will be marked, eventually.
- `Group` If the entry belongs nested under another topic, place the topic name in this column.

The `word-index.py` script generates the .docx file. It takes the following parameters
- `--file` The file to parse. Multiple files can be specified
- `--dir` Parse all files in the specified directory and all subdirectories. Multiple directories can be specified.
- `--output` The name of the Word document to create.

## Repository Structure

- `static/grandindex.html`: The main HTML file that contains the index and links to PDF and DOCX downloads.
- `final/`: Directory that contains the MS Word and PDF versions of the index.
- `sources/`: Directory that contains the tab separated value (TSV) files used to generate the index.

## Access the Index

You can access the **Grand Index** directly at [https://radiofreewaba.net/traveller/grandindex.html](https://radiofreewaba.net/traveller/grandindex.html), where the latest PDF and DOCX versions are available for download.
